# geoblink-fe-angular

This is the AngularJS template for Geoblink's Frontend position exercise.

## Project structure

You can safely **ignore** `backend` folder:

The only files you should modify are in `client` folder.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm i

# serve with hot reload at localhost:5001 (backend at localhost:5002)
npm start
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [Angular 1.5 cli](https://github.com/SwiftySpartan/Angular-1.5-cli/).

## About the backend

Any request to the backend will return the list of states after a delay of 1 second.
Note that they might fail randomly.
